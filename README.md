# Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an A.I x and o game in React.

## Description
It uses an implementation of the mini-max algorithm to simulate its artificial intelligence.
The game has 3 different versions; Player vs Player, Player vs Computer and Computer vs Computer

The Player vs Computer version is the main part of this project. This version has 3 difficulty levels:
* Easy (The computer randomizes moves).
* Medium (Usage of the minimax algorithm starts after the first move).
* Impossible (Full usage of the minimax algorithm).

The computer was made intelligent by the implementation of the [minimax algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&t=494s) with some [alpha-beta prunning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik&t=1659s).
